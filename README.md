## About Simula:

An application called Simula is found on a PC. The application is password protected; a password is requested for authorization. Upon a clicking the button to enter the password the application throws you into a simulation. The application is corrupted and overrun with bugs, there is no way to terminate the simulation manually, to survive the player has only one option to play the Simula and try a complete the simulation. When the simulation begins it recognizes the player is unauthorized and starts to collapse, the player must move forward traversing across platform to avoid the collapse and survive. 

The game should be fun and exhilarating as you need to keep moving forward. The simulation will try to disorient you throughout your journey. The simulation misleads the player into believe that they could reach an exit when the simulation finishes; however, there is no end nor exit. Eventually the player will get consumed by the simulation, either you will fall, or get caught in the collapse. The only thing that you can do is survive for as long as you can. 

How long can you survive?
